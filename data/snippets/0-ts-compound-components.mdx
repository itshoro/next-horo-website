Compound components allow you to expose them via a main component. This is _pretty_ nifty if you want to restrict access to them, for example if they consist of component specific logic that wouldn't work outside of the given main component.

In vanilla JavaScript it is easy to achieve as all you have to do is add a new key to the functional component. In TypeScript you can use the following snippet as a bootstrap.

```tsx
interface ElementProps {
  foo: number;
}

interface CompoundProps {
  bar: string;
}

const Compound: FC<CompoundProps> = (props) => {
  // ...
};

const Element: FC<ElementProps> & { Compound: FC<CompoundProps> } = (props) => {
  // ...
};

Element.Compound = Compound;

export { Element };
```
